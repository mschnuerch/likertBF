<p><b>Welcome!</b></p>

<p>With this Shiny app, you can calculate <b>Bayes factors</b> for the comparison of two distributions 
on an ordinal (e.g., Likert) item. To analyze your data, you must enter the <b>observed category frequencies</b> 
for each condition in the first step. The frequencies must be separated by a , (you can also use ; or /). 
You can <b>plot the data</b> by clicking on the respective button. This
will create an ROC-type plot and a difference plot for the cumulative
proportions in the two conditions. Optionally, you can provide category labels
which will appear in the plot.</p>

<p>The data are modeled as a latent normal distribution where response categories
correspond to ordered regions on the latent scale (as in SDT). Response
probabilities correspond to the areas of the latent regions under the curve, 
and the parameters of interest are the thresholds of these regions in each condition. 
Each threshold in each condition is modeled as some grand mean threshold (alpha) and a specific difference
between conditions (theta).</p>

<p>We specify four statistical models:</p>

 <ul>
  <li><b>Unconstrained Model:</b> No constraints on theta (this model can account for any relationship between response distributions)</li>
  <li><b>Dominance Model:</b> All thetas are positive/negative (one response distribution stochastically dominates the other)</li>
  <li><b>Shift Model:</b> There is one theta for all thresholds (there is a simple effect that may be captured by a shift in probit space)</li>
  <li><b>Null Model:</b> Theta is 0 (there is no difference in response distributions between conditions)</li>
</ul> 

<p>To compare these models by means of Bayes factors, you need to specify <b>priors</b>
on the alphas and thetas. These are centered normal distributions with standard deviation 
b<sub>alpha</sub> and b<sub>theta</sub>. Define these standard deviations to express your prior beliefs.
<b>Note that you must carefully choose the prior settings for the case
at hand</b>. Your choice will affect your conclusions. </p>

<p>You can also specify the settings of the MCMC sampling algorithm. The total number of 
posterior samples must be sufficiently high (e.g., 100,000). You can set the number of chains per parameter (default: 4) and the number of warmup (default: 5000) and posterior samples (default: 25,000). You can check convergence of the MCMC algorithm by <b>plotting posterior samples</b> from the unconstrained model. For each parameter, the chain of samples should look <b>like a hairy caterpillar</b>.</p>
