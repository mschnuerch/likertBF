<p><b>Welcome!</b></p>

<p>With this Shiny app, you can calculate <b>Bayes factors</b> for two distributions 
on some ordinal (e.g., Likert-type) items. To analyze your data, you must enter the <b>observed category frequencies</b> 
for each condition in the first step. The frequencies must be separated by a , (you can also use ; or /). 
You can <b>plot the data</b> by clicking on the respective button. This
will create an ROC-type plot and a difference plot for the cumulative
proportions in the two conditions. Optionally, you can provide category labels
which will appear in the plot.</p>

<p>The data are modeled as a latent normal distribution where response categories
correspond to ordered regions on the latent scale (as in SDT). Response
probabilities correspond to the areas of the latent regions under the curve, 
and the parameters of interest are the bounds of these regions in each condition. 
Each bound in each condition is modeled as some grand mean (alpha) and a specific difference
between conditions (theta).</p>

<p>We specify four statistical models:</p>

 <ul>
  <li><b>Unconstrained Model:</b> No constraints on theta (there is an effect of condition but it's not 
  captured by one relation)</li>
  <li><b>Dominance Model:</b> All thetas are positive/negative (there is an effect in one direction)</li>
  <li><b>Shift Model:</b> There is one theta for all bounds (there is a constant effect)</li>
  <li><b>Null Model:</b> Theta is 0 (there is no difference between conditions)</li>
</ul> 

<p>To compare these models by means of Bayes factors, you need to specify <b>priors</b>
on the alphas and thetas. These are centered normal distributions with standard deviation 
b<sub>alpha</sub> and b<sub>theta</sub>. Define these variances to express your prior beliefs.
<b>Note that you must carefully choose the prior settings for the case
at hand</b>. Your choice will affect your conclusions (as it should). </p>

<p>You can also specify the settings of the MCMC sampling algorithm. The number of 
posterior samples must be sufficiently high (e.g., 200,000). By default, the variances of the
proposal distributions will be tuned before the sampling process to achieve an acceptance
rate of about 30%. Optionally, you can disable auto-tuning and specify these variances yourself. 
You can check convergence of the MCMC algorithm by <b>plotting the chains</b> from the unconstrained model.</p>
